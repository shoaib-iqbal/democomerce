# # Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# # and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# # than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
# #
# # To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
# #
# #     I18n.t 'hello'
# #
# # In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
# #
# #     <%= t('hello') %>
# #
# # To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
# #
# #     I18n.locale = :es
# #
# # This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
# #
# # To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# # available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.
